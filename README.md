# Getting started

Have a look at our YouTube channel 
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl2VPe7OrnznNtrh0_lwrqQ where we provide video tutorials. 
Additionally, the graphical user interface of VieSched++ contains a build in help. 
Read the text on the welcome page for more information.

# Installation

__Installers for Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04 are provided through the release page on GitHub!__

Visit https://github.com/TUW-VieVS/VieSchedpp/releases.

## Manual installation

The software consists of two parts:
* VieSched++: the scheduler (this repository)
* VieSched++ GUI: the graphical user interface, hostet on https://github.com/TUW-VieVS/VieSchedppGUI

__It is highly recommended to use the GUI to create the VieSchedpp.xml input files!__

Have a look at https://github.com/TUW-VieVS/VieSchedppGUI/blob/master/README.md for installing the GUI.

### Installation of VieSched++

This section descripes how to install __VieSched++__ on LINUX.

While an installation is possible on Windows (tested with Windows 10) it is no
further discussed due to the many possibilieties of different compilers and options.

If you run into any problems compiling __VieSched++__, contact me
under matthias.schartner@geo.tuwien.ac.at and I can send you some pre-build binaries.

The source code is hosted at two git repositories:
* https://github.com/TUW-VieVS/VieSchedpp.git (public)
* https://git.geo.tuwien.ac.at/vievs/VieSchedpp/VieSchedpp.git (inside TU Vienna GEO Domain)

### Dependencies

Before you install __VieSched++__ check if you have the following dependencies installed:

* gcc/g++ (tested with version 7.2.0, 7.3.0 and 8.1.0)
  * possible installation on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install build-essentials`
* SOFA libraries
  * check out git project `https://git.geo.tuwien.ac.at/vievs/VieSchedpp/IAU_SOFA.git` (inside TU-Wien GEO domain) or visit http://www.iausofa.org/
  * The SOFA library has to be locate in `../IAU_SOFA/Release`, otherwise change search path in `CMakeLists.txt` file manually
* boost c++ libraries (tested with version 1.58.00, 1.64.0 and 1.67.0)
  * possible installation on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev` or check out https://www.boost.org/
* cmake (tested with Version 3.8 and 3.12)
  * possible installation on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install cmake` or visit https://cmake.org/
* some other basic dependencies should already be part of your operating system or previous packages

### Recommended software folder structure

The full software contains 4 different packages which are all available in git under `git.geo.tuwien.ac.at/vievs/VieSchedpp/` (Inside the TU-Wien GEO domain). Two of the packages are also available on github `https://github.com/TUW-VieVS/`. 

It is recommended to copy the source code into one common directory here called `VieVS`

    VieVS/VieSchedpp
    VieVS/VieSchedppGUI
    VieVS/IAU_SOFA (only for installation)
    VieVS/CATALOGS (not required for installation)

### Build

clone git repository into `VieVS` or copy source code into `VieVS/VieSchedpp`

    cd VieVS
    git clone https://github.com/TUW-VieVS/VieSchedpp.git

make sure that the `IAU_SOFA` library is already build in `VieVS/IAU_SOFA/Release/libsofa_c.a`.
See `README.md` from `IAU_SOFA` for help.

browse to newly created folder `VieSchedpp`

    cd VieSchedpp

create new folder `Release` and browse there

    mkdir Release
    cd Release

run CMake with `Release` flag with `CMakeLists.txt` from parent directory:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

run make

    make

You should now be able to find the program in `VieVS/VieSchedpp/Release`

### Build without c++ boost libraries

Do the same as descriped in the previouse section but before running
`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. ` open file `CMakeLists.txt` in
`VieVS/VieSchedpp/` and change the boost blocks.
(commend first block and uncommend second block)

# Documentation

The Documentation of the __VieSched++__ source code can be found at https://tuw-vievs.github.io/VieSchedpp/index.html.

**WARNING:** This documentation always refers to the actual `master` branch on `GitHub`. This might be different then your personal version. 

## Create documentation by yourself

To create a documentation you should have installed `doxygen` and optionally
the `dot` tool from `Graphviz`.
If you want to create diagrams make sure that the `dot` executable is in your
path variable.

### Via batch file

Run the `createDocumentation_linux.sh` bash script or `createDocumentation_windows.bat` batch file.
(Make sure you have the appropriate file permissions to run the script. If not run `chmod 711 createDocumentation_linux.sh` or equivalent windows commands before)

You should now get a `index.html` link and a `refman.pdf` file in your `VieSchedpp/documentation/` directory.

The `index.html` file is the startpoint of your manual in `html` format.

### Directly via doxygen

To create a documentation run `doxygen` in the `VieSchedpp/documentation/`
subfolder.

This should create a `html` and `latex` documentation.

For more infos visit http://www.doxygen.nl/.

----

If your Output contains some `CMake` warnings like:

    CMake Warning at /usr/share/cmake-3.5/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:725 (message):
      Imported targets not available for Boost version 106400

check if your `CMake` version supports `boost` version and install the newest version of CMake from https://cmake.org/.

----

If you get error messages during linking with functions called: `*boost*` or `iau_*`:

Check if your `c++ boost libraries` and the `SOFA` library is found. If not set the path to this libraries in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

----

If you have troubles getting `boost` to work simply try to build it without `c++ boost libraries` (header only - see `CMakeLists.txt` file `BOOST` section).

If you still have troubles installing the software contact me under: matthias.schartner@geo.tuwien.ac.at.
